# polygon_coverage_planning
This package contains implementations to compute coverage patterns and shortest paths in general polygon with holes.
Please cite our [accompanying publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.09224) when using it.

## Installation on Ubuntu 18.04 and ROS melodic
Install [ROS melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu).
Install [mono](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-lin-ubuntu).

Create a workspace.
```
cd ~
mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
cd catkin_ws
catkin init
catkin config --extend /opt/ros/melodic
```

Download package dependencies from [dependencies.rosinstall](install/dependencies.rosinstall).
**Note**: If you have not setup [SSH keys in GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) use [dependencies_https.rosinstall](install/dependencies_https.rosinstall).
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone git@github.com:ethz-asl/polygon_coverage_planning.git
wstool init
wstool merge polygon_coverage_planning/install/dependencies.rosinstall
wstool update
```


Install all [remaining dependencies](https://github.com/ethz-asl/polygon_coverage_planning/blob/master/install/prepare-jenkins-slave.sh):
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/polygon_coverage_planning/install
./prepare-jenkins-slave.sh
```

Finally, build the workspace.
```
catkin build
```

## Getting Started
The package has a ROS interface for shortest path planning and coverage planning.
First source your workspace to execute any of the nodes.
```
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

### Coverage Planning
```
roslaunch polygon_coverage_ros coverage_planner.launch
```

The polygon can be set via
- ROS [service](polygon_coverage_msgs/srv/PolygonService.srv) call `rosservice call /coverage_planner/set_polygon`
- ROS [parameter](polygon_coverage_ros/launch/coverage_planner.launch) `/coverage_planner/polygon` or
- RVIZ Polygon Tool as in the video above.

The plan is generated via
- ROS [service](https://github.com/ethz-asl/mav_comm/blob/master/mav_planning_msgs/srv/PlannerService.srv) call 'rosservice call /coverage_planner/plan_path' or
- clicking start and goal points using the RVIZ clicked_point tool as in the video above.

### Euclidean Shortest Path Planning
```
roslaunch polygon_coverage_ros shortest_path_planner.launch
```

Setting the polygon and planning the path is the same as for Coverage Planning.
